**2018**
<br>
I learned ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) with using ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white) OS

**2019**
<br>
I started to use ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) when I write the code. I also used ![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/pycharm-143?style=for-the-badge&logo=pycharm&logoColor=black&color=black&labelColor=green) ![Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-%2344A833.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white) because I was studying ML(Machine Learning) with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

**2020**
<br>
It was a hard time for me, I was keep studying ML/AI but, I couldn't feel I'm doing well on this.

**2021**
<br>
I strated to feel I don't know what can I do in the future, if I keep studying ML/AI because when I keep studying I feel everything is just controlled by Google or Amazon. 

So I was trying to find out something I could enjoy much better. I tryed to use open API with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) and I also try to make an APP with ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37) which is based on ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) and I also try to use ![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=%2361DAFB) which is using ![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) language, and at end of the year I got some project offer from my friend.

- When I use both Expo and Flutter, I prefer Flutter, because the Dart language was very simple to use. But I didn't choose Flutter for my next project. Because it's still developing and I feel it's not stable yet.

#### <a href="https://github.com/KULib-Project"><text>Team Project Part</text></a>
Finaly my friends and I started planning our project. Two of my friends want to be in a Back-End position and I was only Front-End. Anyway, we discuss about what we want to build and we make a conclude to make our school library APP. After that, we have to decide what we are going to use.

**Back-End**: ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

**Deploy**: ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)

**Front-End**: ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37)
    
We decide like this and we start to work on it, at first we thought we could end it at least six month, but it has lots of things to do on Front-End much more than we thought, so we find some more teammates and two more joined to our project. So, this project does currently not end yet.
When we start to make our App we could use Google Login API, but our school decide to move our school email to another service so we have to eject Expo and move to React Native.
    
**Back-End**: ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

**Deploy**: ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)

**Front-End**: ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37) -> ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
