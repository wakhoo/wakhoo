**2018**
    I learned ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white) ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) with using ![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white) OS

**2019**
    I started to use ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white) when I write the code. I also used ![PyCharm](https://img.shields.io/badge/pycharm-143?style=for-the-badge&logo=pycharm&logoColor=black&color=black&labelColor=green) ![Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-%2344A833.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white) because I was studying ML(Muchine Learning) with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

- I write some paper with my friends about NLP(Natural Leanguage Process), but it was not good paper. 
    
    
**2020**
It was hard time for me, I was keep studying ML/AI but, I couldn't feel I'm doing well on this.
- Movie Recommend Project
    

**2021**
    I was strated to feeling I don't know what can I do in future, if I keep studying ML/AI, because when I keep study I feel everything is just contorlled by Google or Amazon. 

So I was try to find out something I could enjoy much better. I tryed to use openAPI with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) and I also try to make some APP with ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37) which is based on ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=&logoColor=%2361DAFB) and I also try to use ![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=%2361DAFB) which is using ![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dart-%230175C2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white) language, and end of the year I got some project offer from my friend.

- When I use both Expo and Flutter, I prefer Flutter, because the Dart language was very simple to use. But I didn't choice Flutter to my next project. Because it's still developing and I feel it's not stable yet.

#### Team Project Part
Finaly my friends and I started to planning our project. Two of my friends want to be a Back-End position and I was only Front-End. Anyway we discuss about what we want to build and we make a conclusion to make our school library APP. After that we have to decide what we are going to use.

**Back-End**: ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

**Deploy**: ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)

**Front-End**: ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37)
    
We decide like this and we start to work on, at first we could end this in at least six month, but it has lots of things to do in Front-end much more than we thought, so we find some more team mates and two more joined to our project. So, this project is currently not end yet, and first we could use Google Login API, but our school decide to move our school email to other service to we have to eject Expo and move to React Native.
    
**Back-End**: ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

**Deploy**: ![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-430098?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)

**Front-End**: ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37) -> ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
